### Objectives
When playing this game, the goal is to beat your opponent/friend in a one vs one match.
The player controls an in-game paddle, structured as a rectangle, by moving it up and down the screen. You will compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. The players will use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach seven points before the opponent.
### Gameplay Instructions
#### Normal Pong
Player 1 will use the keys "W" and 'S" to make the paddle move up and down. Player 1 will control the paddle on the left side. Player 2 will use the arrow keys the "↑" and "↓" to make the paddle move up and down. Player 2 will control the paddle on the right side.
#### Action Pong
The controls are the same as in normal pong, but there are different modes that affect the game
###### RING OF FIRE!!!
There will be a square of fire, whenever a ball hits a side of the square, it will move faster.
###### DON'T TOUCH THE CAT!!!
A cat will be moving up and down the middle of the screen. When you hit the cat, you will lose a life. You start off with three lives. Once you lose all three lives, YOU LOSE. If the ball moves off the screen you still lose instantly.
###### BIG BALL, SMALL PADDLES!!!
The game will start with a big ball in the middle, the paddles will be much smaller. The speed of the ball will increase slightly. The players will have a harder time hitting it back at each other.
###### SECRET WALL?!!!
There will be an invisible wall, that won't be seen until the ball hits the wall. The wall will make the ball bounce back
###### MULTIBALL!!!
At the start of the game, two balls will appear instead of one. They will go in different directions. Use the secret of timing to win!
### Scoring
Both players will start at zero points. Whenever a play misses and lets the ball go to side, the player on the opposite side will recieve a point. Whenever a player reaches seven points, they will win the game. There is a max of 13 games
### Functionality and Limitations
When playing the game, some players may play for fun. This is fine for this game, except that at there is a max of 13 games, not unlimited. Another limitation is how you can only use your keyboard to play, no mouse presses are used when playing this game, some may enjoy using mouse presses instead of key presses.
